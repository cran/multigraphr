\title{Goodness of fit tests for random multigraph models}
\usage{
gof_test(adj, type, hyp, deg.hyp, dof)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{matrix of integer representing graph adjacency matrix.}

\item{type}{equals \code{'graph'} if adjacency matrix is for graphs (default),
equals \code{'multigraph'} if it is the equivalence of the adjacency matrix for multigraphs
(with matrix diagonal representing loops double counted).}

\item{hyp}{character string representing the null model, either \code{'IEAS'} or \code{'ISA'}.}

\item{deg.hyp}{vector of integers with the sum equal to to 2\code{m} representing the
degree sequence of the multigraph under the null model: \cr
  - if \code{hyp = 'IEAS'}, then simple IEAS hypothesis with fully specified degree sequence \code{deg.hyp}\cr
  - if \code{hyp = 'ISA'}, then simple ISA hypothesis with with fully specified stub assignment probabilities \code{deg.hyp}/2\code{m}\cr
  - if \code{hyp = 'IEAS'} and \code{deg.hyp = 0}, then composite IEAS hypothesis with edge multiplicity sequence estimated from data\cr
  - if \code{hyp = 'ISA'} and \code{deg.hyp = 0}, then composite ISA hypothesis with edge multiplicity sequence estimated from data\cr}

\item{dof}{integer giving degrees of freedom of test,
\emph{r-1} for simple hypotheses and \emph{r-n} for composite hypotheses where \emph{r = n(n+1)/2}}
}
\value{
\item{summary}{Data frame including observed  values of test statistics \code{S} and \code{A},
 degrees of freedom for the asymptotic chi^2-distributions of tests statistics,
 and \emph{p}-values for the tests performed.}
}
\description{
Goodness of fit tests between an observed edge multiplicity sequence and
an expected edge multiplicity sequence according to specified RSM or IEA hypotheses
using Pearson (\emph{S}) and information divergence (\emph{A}) tests statistics.
}
\details{
This function can be used to test whether there is a significant difference between
 observed multigraph and the expected multiplicity sequence according
 to a simple or composite IEA hypothesis.

 Test statistics of Pearson (\emph{S}) and of information divergence (\emph{A}) type are used and
 test summary based on these two statistics are given as output.

 \emph{p}-values indicate whether we have sufficient evidence to reject the null
 that there is no significant difference between the observed and
 expected edge multiplicity sequence.

\examples{
# Adjacency matrix of observed network (multigraph), n = 4 nodes , m = 15 edges
A <- t(matrix(c( 0, 1, 0, 3,
                   0, 0, 1, 7,
                   0, 1, 0, 3,
                   3, 6, 3, 2), nrow= 4, ncol=4))
deg <- get_degree_seq(adj = A, type = 'multigraph')

# Testing a simple IEAS hypothesis with above degree sequence
gof_test(adj = A, type = 'multigraph', hyp = 'IEAS', deg.hyp = deg, dof = 9)

# Testing a composite IEAS hypothesis
gof_test(adj = A, type  = 'multigraph', hyp = 'IEAS', deg.hyp = 0, dof = 6)
